# MP1.7 - Defect Campaign Across Axis Complexity

## Goal

Map defect response across single-axis, dual-axis, and three-axis structures.

## Defect set

- Vacancy
- Substitutional: H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Al, P, Fe, Ge, Sn
- Interstitial: substitutional set plus Si

## Deliverables

- Defect formation energies and preferred sites by model class
- Bader/electronic signatures for selected representatives
- Cross-axis trend tables

## Checklist

- [ ] Define priority subset for main-text figures
- [ ] Build full defect matrix for supplemental data
- [ ] Run standardized post-processing and QC
- [ ] Draft defect-focused micro-paper outputs
